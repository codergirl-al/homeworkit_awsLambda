# HomeworkIt Backend

Hello friend,

Homeworkit is a project I've started with the purpose to help schooling systems with the evaluation and management of tasks and homeworks.

This is only the backend, frontend is still under construction.

To open the project you have to:

- configure aws credentials (since we're using serverless).
- clone the repo and write "npm install" in the terminal.
- since serverless offline is installed, you can run "serverless offline".
- take a look at everything, why not contribute if you have any ideas.

ps. Amazon Cognito config coming soon
